# vehicle-parking-management
## A Project for Vehicle Parking Management written in C++

  The aim of this project is to implement various concepts of Object Oriented Programming in a
real world based application using language C++. The main objective of the project for Vehicle
Parking Management is to provide and mange vehicles by their type and create and edit permanent
log files of the driven data. In this project, following utilities are provided-

*1) Add new vehicle*

*2) Search for a vehicle*

*3) Delete an existing vehicle*

*4) Update a vehicle*

*5) List all vehicles available in log file*

*6) Check earned money from log file*

To get a brief idea about structure and logic of the project, I am adding a report file 'report.md'
with a class diagram which represents classes, their inter-dependencies and functionalities.

I have included demo .txt files of sample data to understand the working of file handling.
